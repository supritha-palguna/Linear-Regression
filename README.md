# Linear Regression

The goal of this project is to apply linear regression to analyze data from the used cars
dataset advertised on the e-commerce platform Exchange and Mart in UK in the year
2020. Initially, data preparation is accomplished to transform the data into a format that
will be used later in the analysis. After preparing the data, descriptive analysis is carried
out using statistical measures such as mean. By validating the assumptions provided on
the linear model, a decision is made to opt between price and log-transformed price as
the response variable. The best subset is then determined using the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) statistic selection criteria. Finally, the model’s coefficients and statistical
significance are interpreted, and the model’s goodness of fit is assessed.
